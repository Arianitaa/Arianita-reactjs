                    <p>Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found
                        in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, 
                        capabilities, and habits of the individuals in these groups.[1]

                        Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and 
                        socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.
                        
                        A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline 
                        for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a 
                        template for expectations in a social group. Accepting only a monoculture in a social
                         group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of 
                         environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.[2] Thus in 
                         military culture, valor is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, 
                         honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses
                          in the continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can 
                          be identified in a social group.</p>

                Humans are social creatures. Since the dawn of Homo 
                sapiens nearly 250,000 years ago, people have grouped
                together into communities in order to survive. Living together, 
                people form common habits and behaviors—from specific methods of
                 childrearing to preferred techniques for obtaining food.

            <div> <p>Art and Literature</p>
                    <p>Art and Literature are bound together in several ways. Great works of art have
                         inspired great works of literature, great works of literature have inspired art,
                          and together art and literature have simultaneously represented similar movements.</p>

             <div> <p>Costums and Traditions </p>
                <p>The main difference between custom and tradition lies in the length of time associated with them.
                     A custom is a commonly accepted manner of behaving or doing something in a particular society,
                     place or time. A tradition is the transmission of customs or beliefs from generation to generation.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Architecture</p>
                <p>Architecture is an expression of culture. Architecture must acknowledge the cultural needs
                     and values of the society it interacts with. When an architect begins to create or 
                     construct a building they must see the culture of the people around them.</p>
